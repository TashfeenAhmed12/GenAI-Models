# ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection with DETR (Facebook ResNet-50)

This project demonstrates how to perform **object detection** on images using the **Hugging Face Transformers** library and the **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** model by Facebook.  
It detects and labels multiple objects within an image, draws bounding boxes, and saves the annotated output.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses **Hugging Face Transformers** for object detection (`facebook/detr-resnet-50`)
- Automatically detects and labels multiple objects in an image
- Draws bounding boxes around detected objects
- Allows easy **customization** via your own `image_labeling.py` module
- Supports image resizing and saving labeled outputs
