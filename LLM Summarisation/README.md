### ðŸ§  Example 1: English Text Summarization

**Input:**
The US has passed the peak on new coronavirus cases, 
President Donald Trump said and predicted that some states would reopen this month.
The US has over 637,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 30,826 deaths, the highest
for any country in the world. Global cases have exceeded 2.5 million and more than 171,000
people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US has seen a sharp economic downturn, 
with at least 22 million people filing for unemployment in the last month. The pandemic has led to the 
postponement of elections in many countries and the delay of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The World Health 
Organization has warned that the coronavirus "may never go away" and could become endemic like HIV. 

**Output:**
The US has recorded its highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University, the US government has said.
