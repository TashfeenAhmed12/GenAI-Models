    "# Fine-Tuning a Conversational LLM for Psychological Dialogue Support\n",
    "\n",
    "This project fine-tunes a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate natural, empathetic, and context-aware conversations between a psychologist and a patient. The model learns from a curated dataset of real or synthetic therapy-style question–answer exchanges, allowing it to generate emotionally intelligent, coherent, and supportive responses to mental-health-related queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike general chatbots trained on open-domain text, this model specializes in therapeutic conversation patterns — focusing on reflective listening, validating emotions, and suggesting healthy thought reframing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is an AI-driven conversational agent that can engage in mental-wellness dialogue, provide psychoeducation, and guide users toward constructive self-reflection — without offering clinical diagnosis or treatment."
